# New Member Manager

A Discord dashboard to quickly deal with a sudden influx of unwanted server members. Log in through Discord, find your server and easily get rid of a raid or bots.

## Introduction

If 200 bots join your server, it's annoying enough to see them
in the welcome channel, and even more annoying to ban each one of them. New Member Manager makes it easy to get rid of them all in under 30 seconds. No more manual banning of each one.
